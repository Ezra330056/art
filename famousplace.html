It is about 1 mile (1.6 km) in length, .5 miles (0.80 km) in width, about 3 miles (4.8 km) in circumference and about 60 feet (18 m) in depth. 
                            Rih Lake occupies an important status in the traditional religion and folktales of the Chin people, including the Zomi, Laimi, and Mizo. According to the ancestors of these tribes, the lake was a corridor to their heaven called Pialral. All souls destined to Pialral must pass through the lake. Due to its cultural importance is often referred to as "the largest lake of Mizoram is Rih Dil, which is but in Burma (Myanmar).</p>

                            The best mode of transport with which to reach the waterfall is a motorbike taxi from Matupi, because there is no bridge for cars to cross Bon Laung creek, which is six miles from the waterfall.
                            Hti Saung is around ten miles from Matupi—from just beyond the village, the upper tiers of the waterfall are visible.
                            Two miles past the village, a path leads to the waterfall. Though it would be possible to widen the path so that cars are able to use it, locals are opposed to building a road, and insist on taking a two-mile walk to the waterfall.</p>

Another story says a monk's asceticism impressed a celestial king, who used his powers to place the rock where it is, as it resembles the monk's head. It's the third most important Buddhist pilgrimage site in Myanmar, after the Shwedagon Pagoda and the Mahamuni Pagoda.

Constructed on raised ground with a single entrance and small windows, it may have served as a refuge during times of war. The temple features a central dome with a mushroom-shaped crown and four smaller stupas at the corners. A unique square window allows sunlight to directly illuminate the main Buddha image at dawn. Inside, there are three chambers housing a total of 180 Buddha images, surrounded by sculptures representing the donors who funded the temple's construction.</p>

It has five stacked terraces with rows of small stupas, totaling 108, symbolizing Buddha's marks. The entrance is marked by a notch, leading to a platform where a small stupa and Buddha image once stood, likely sheltered by a roof. The pagoda's design, influenced by Sri Lankan architecture, features brick and sandstone construction with vaulted galleries adorned with Buddha images, though some parts collapsed due to earthquakes. The exact count of 90,000 Buddha images remains uncertain, but the monument's grandeur reflects King Min Dikkha's ambition and religious devotion.</p>

It was originally built by King Migadippa in the 7th century AD and later refurbished by King Dhammazedi in the late 15th century. The impressive statues stand without any cover, making them visible from far away and providing a remarkable sight for visitors.</p>

In ancient times during the Pyu city-states era, it was an important city, possibly even a local capital. Nowadays, it's mainly known for its hot springs and historical sites. Beikthano, along with Hanlin and Sri Ksetra, are ancient cities of the Pyu Kingdom recognized by UNESCO for their archaeological significance dating back over 1,000 years. Beikthano, the oldest urban site discovered and excavated, dates from around 200 BCE to 100 CE. Named after the Hindu god Vishnu, it might have been the first capital of a unified state in Myanmar's history. The city was quite large, surrounded by thick walls and fortifications, with the main entrance leading to the palace. Stupas and monastic buildings have also been found within the city walls.</p>

It was raised from its original height of 55.5 feet (16.9 m) to a height of 87 feet (27 m) by King Saw Lu (1077-1084) of Bagan. The pagoda faced a huge earthquake in 1847 and it was rebuilt by the mayor of Magway, Min Din Min Hla Kyaw Gaung to the present height of approximately 104 feet (32 m).

Bagan's prosperity attracted people from various regions, contributing to its diverse population and thriving economy. However, the empire eventually declined due to Mongol invasions, leading to Bagan's transformation from a bustling city to a smaller settlement. Today, Bagan is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination, known for its thousands of well-preserved temples and pagodas, despite facing challenges such as earthquakes and controversial restoration efforts.</p>

People say the city fell because of bad things that happened, like natural disasters or bad rulers. In 2014, Hanlin, along with two other places, got listed as special by UNESCO because of its old stuff, which goes back more than 1,000 years. New testing even suggests Hanlin might be the oldest place from the Stone Age in Southeast Asia, which makes it even cooler.

Though the journey from Dawei takes about 3-4 hours, the scenic drive passes through charming fishing villages, giving a glimpse of rural life. Before reaching the pagoda, travelers can stop at Myin Kwa Aw Beach, where there's a cozy café called "The Village Natural Café" for refreshments. The pagoda itself is not only a place of worship but also a place to enjoy the beauty of the sea. Its peaceful atmosphere, combined with the sound of the waves, makes it a soothing destination.</p>

It's known for its stunning natural beauty and colorful coral reefs. This island has a historical connection, being named after one of the famous warriors who fought for King Anawratha in the Bagan region. In the past, under British rule, it was called McKenzie Island, but it's now known by its more exotic Myanmar name, adding to its charm. Located at the southern end of the Mergui Archipelago, it's a place of allure and mystique, accessible best from Kawthaung.</p>

It's believed to be really, really old, possibly more than 2,500 years old, dating back to when the Buddha was alive. Legend says two merchants got hair from the Buddha and built the pagoda to keep it safe. The pagoda is super important because it's said to hold relics from four Buddhas, making it really sacred. It sits on top of a hill and is really tall, so you can see its golden dome from far away. It's a big deal in Yangon and a must-visit for tourists.

It's super important in the country's politics, beliefs, and where it is on the map. People say it was built even before the famous Shwedagon Pagoda, like, over 2,600 years ago, which is really ancient! According to stories, a spirit showed where to build the Shwedagon Pagoda right where the Sule Pagoda is now. This place has been a big deal in Yangon's and Myanmar's history, especially during protests like in 1988, 2007, and 2021. The pagoda looks like a big octagon and it's 46 meters tall, with a shiny golden top that you can see from far away. It's a mix of Indian and local styles, making it special and respected by everyone in Yangon.</p>

It's man-made, meaning people built it, and it's there to give clean water to the city, which was important during the time when the British controlled Myanmar. The lake is about 3 miles around and not very deep, maybe about 20 to 45 inches. Around the lake, there's a big park called Kandawgyi Nature Park and a zoo called Yangon Zoological Gardens, which also has an aquarium and a fun park. On one side of the lake, there's a famous building called Karaweik, which looks like an old royal boat and now has a restaurant inside. There used to be a club for rowing there, but now it's a hotel, although sadly it got badly damaged by a fire in 2017.</p>

It's housed in a two-story house that used to be his home before he was sadly killed in 1947. Built in 1921, this colonial-style villa was where his daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, spent her childhood. Inside, you can find things from General Aung San's life, like clothes, books, furniture, and even his car. For a long time, the museum was only open for a few hours each year, on 19 July, but it's been officially open again since 2012. This museum is important because it helps people remember General Aung San and his contributions to Myanmar's history.</p>
