                <h2>Recycled-1708</h2>
                <p>The “Recycled” series is a very personal project for Htein Lin. When he was in prison, he created many works on A4 paper in secret, which he managed to covertly get out and sent to his wife to get them to safety. Unfortunately, these works ended up at the paper recycler. Upon his release from prison, Htein Lin bought the cardboards from recycling, thinking there was some of his work inside. Since then, when an emotion touches him, an event disturbs him - or rejoices him, he draws and restores his thoughts on these "recycled". We have here a tender evocation of Lotus' flowers on the Irrawaddy River.</p>

          <h2>The Cloud And The Sea</h2>
          <p>The image presents a whimsical and abstract interpretation of a seascape, where the sky and sea converge in a dance of colors and shapes. Dominating the upper portion, stylized clouds outlined in a gentle red hue float serenely against a backdrop of soft turquoise, reminiscent of a calm sky on a warm day. These clouds, with their repetitive patterns, evoke a sense of rhythm and movement, as if they are adrift on a gentle breeze. Below, the sea is depicted in a contrasting greyish-blue tone, its stillness suggesting the quiet depths of the ocean. Separating these two realms is a thin strip of green, peppered with smaller, multi-colored cloud-like forms, serving as an abstract horizon line that anchors the composition. The image, devoid of any distinct landmarks or figures, invites the viewer to interpret the scene through the lens of their imagination, where the boundaries between the sky and sea blur into a harmonious blend of nature’s elements.xx`</p>
